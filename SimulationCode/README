The file naivebayes.py implements Naive Bayes training and scoring.
The three folders represent the three different settings for the Monte Carlo simulations:

- OneXR:
	The "true" distribution is assumed to have only one feature from XR.

- XSXR:
	The "true" distribution is assumed to have all features from XS and XR but not FK.

- XSFK:
	The "true" distribution is assumed to have all features from XS and FK only.
